# stanescu-map-projection
A compromise map projection made by Constantin-Ciprian Stanescu on december 25th, 2025,
based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron" target="_blank">regular octahedron</a> layout similar to Cahill's "Butterfly", and Keyes' "M-shaped" projections, but targeting the simplicity and familiarity of the Mercator projection.
Principal dividing meridian is 25°W, to show almost all the continents and countries uninterrupted. Map ratio is 1:0.347. Printed & cropped 2D map can be folded into a 3D octahedron Earth.
