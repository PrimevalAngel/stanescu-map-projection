A compromise map projection made by Constantin-Ciprian Stanescu on December 25, 2025,
<br>based on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_octahedron" target="_blank">regular octahedron</a> layout 
similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernard_J._S._Cahill" target="_blank">Cahill's "Butterfly"</a>, 
and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cahill%E2%80%93Keyes_projection" target="_blank">Keyes' "M-shaped"</a> projections, but targeting the simplicity and familiarity 
of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercator_projection" target="_blank">Mercator</a> projection.
<br>
<br>Principal dividing meridian is 25°W, to show almost all the continents and countries uninterrupted. 
<br>
<br>Map ratio is 1:0.347. 
<br>
<br>Printed & cropped 2D map can be folded into a 3D octahedron Earth.
